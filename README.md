# Text-Based-Adventure-Game
Final Prioject for the first CS course I took at SNHU - Scripting in Python

The purpose of the game is move from room to room and collect all characters before entering the final room. Data is stored in dictionary format and functions are used for moving rooms and aquiring characters. A class was created for the character to track the characters obtained and what room they are curently in. An exit function currently does not exist in the program. I missed that part for the final project, and didn't add or edit anything prior to upload. If I were to do so it would be a simple exit function, with the option added to the control flow to end the while statement, ending the whole program. 

To play on your own device make sure you have python downloaded.
